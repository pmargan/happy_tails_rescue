# Purpose
The purpose of this application is to provide the client (Happy Tails Animal Rescue) with a website. The client already had a website made by a volunteer with WordPress however this was not updated regularly, links were broken, the website rendered slowly and had many unnecessary pages. The website also no longer had listings of available animals that are available for adoption. The client agreed that this should be the main purpose of the website.

The new website would contain information on the organisation, available adoptable animals and available foster animals (including all relevant info on the animal). It will also contain information on recommended vet clinics, Happy Tails programs, donations. The forms for adoption, fostering, volunteering, surrendering an animal are also available on the website.
