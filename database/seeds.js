                Caring for our Golden Tails involves a great many things; from prescription food, medication, rehabilitation services, surgeries and

                save a life, to make their life better.
                When you sponsor an animal, you will receive a sponsorship packet which includes: details about your sponsored animal and their daily 
                needs, a sponsorship certificate with a photo, and a report on the animalâ€™s well-being. And of course, youâ€™ll also get that good feeling

                thank you for giving a rescue animal a second chance at both love and life. Each Happy Tails animal is placed into a dedicated foster home 
                where their true personality gets to shine. For some of our animals, this is the first time they have been in a loving home. They spend 
                time learning how to be a part of a family, learning to trust and learning to love again. To ensure our animals are adoption ready, they 
                have a thorough veterinary examination which includes a full health check, vaccination/s, spay or castration procedure, microchip implanted 
                and are treated monthly for fleas, worms and ticks. If an animal has further medical or behavioural needs, these are completed prior to 
                being placed up for adoption. All of this helps us learn what each animal needs to have a Happy Tail`,
